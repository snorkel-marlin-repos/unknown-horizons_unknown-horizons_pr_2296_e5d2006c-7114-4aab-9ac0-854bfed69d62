# Create a SQL dump of a SQLite database.
#
# This is used to provide diffs of .sqlite files when using Git.
# It needs at least git 1.6.1.
# To set it up, add the following to your ~/.gitconfig or .git/config:
#
# [diff "sqlite"]
#         textconv = sqlite3dump
#
# And make sure this file is in your PATH. Now git log/git diff/gitk/tig/etc.
# should show diffs of the .sqlite files.


sqlite3 "$1" .dump
